## Devlog
I think a Unity Scene is like a stage where the whole performance takes place. GameObjects are the actors and props—like the player, platforms, and coins—all placed on that stage. Each GameObject can have different Components added to it, kind of like how actors have costumes, roles, or actions. When you put all of that together, the “show” becomes a full game experience.
